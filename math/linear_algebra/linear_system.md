# Linear System
### Solving Linear Systems $Ax=b$
* Solve for $x$
* There may be $0$, $1$, or infinite number of solutions
* Augmented matrix: Matrix formed by concating $A$ with $b$ 
* Row reduction operators:
  1. Add a multiple of one row to another
  2. Multiply a row by non-zero scalar
  3. Permute two rows
 * The goal of row reduction is to get the augmented matrix to echelon form.
  1.
  2.
  3.
* Reduced row echelon form
### Existence and Uniqueness
* Linear systems can have 0, 1, or infinite solutions.
