# System of Linear Equations and Linear Transformations
## System of Lienar Equations
## Linear Transformations
* A linear transformation $T$ has the following properties:
  * Additivity: $T(x + y) = Tx + Ty$
  * Scalar multiplication: $T(cx) = cTx$ 
* Any linear transformation can be represented by matrix multiplication, meaning that the equation $Ax=b$ can also represent linear transformation represented by vector $A$ applied to input $x$ getting output $b$.  

# Vector Spaces
* A space contains mathematical objects and operations that can be performed on those objects. Those objects must have 
## Vector Subspaces
* A subset of a vector space $V$ is a vector subspace iff it satisfies the following properties:
  *  Closure under addtion: For any two vectors $x$ and $y$ in $V$, $x + y$ is also in $V$.
  *  Closure under scalar multiplication: For any vector $x$ in $V$ and scalar $c$, $cx$ is also in $V$. This also includes the case where $c=0$.

# Orthogonality
## Inner Product Space
## Definiton of Orthogonality
# Two vectors are orthogonal if their inner product is $0$. 
# Two vector subspaces $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal if the inner product of any vector

# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
## Defintion of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
* The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of any square matrix $A$ are any $\lambda$ and $x \ne 0$ respectively satisfying the equation $Ax=\lambda x$
