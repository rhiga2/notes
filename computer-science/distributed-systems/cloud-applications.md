Cloud Applications
==================
# Introduction
## Why cloud?
* Scalablity and elasticity: meets demand
* Locality: able to service customers in regions using data centers in close proximity
* Reliability: multi-zone data centers prevent outages in many cases
* Ease: do not need to physically manage servers
## Different abstractions of cloud computing:
* Infra as a Service (IAAS): rent virtual compute and storage resources.
  * You have to manage OS and middleware   
* Platform as a Service (PAAS): managed envs provided by many providers
  * You only have to manage application and data, but you have less control over env.   
* Software as a Service (SAAS): IAAS and PAAS are solutions for application developers. SAAS pertrains to end users.
   * Software that does not need to be installed or updated on local computer. Works in browser
