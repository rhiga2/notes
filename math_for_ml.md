# Probability
## Axioms
1. Non-negativity $P(A) \ge 0$
2. 
## Conditioning, Independence, and Bayes Rule
## Random Variables (RVs)
* A random variable is a function $X: \Omega \rightarrow mathbb{R}$ mapping an element of the same space to a number.
* Functions of RVs are RVs
## Expectations, Variance, and Moments
## Joint and Conditional Distributions
## Conditional Expectations
* $E[X|Y]$ is a function of $Y$
* Law of total expectations

# Linear Algebra
