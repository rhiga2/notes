Probabability
=================
# Probability
## Axioms
1. Non-negativity: $P(A) \ge 0$
2. Unity: $P(\Omega) = 1$
3. Mutually exclusive events: $P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n$

## Conditioning, Independence, and Bayes Rule
## Random Variables (RVs)
* A random variable is a function $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ mapping an element of the same space to a number.
* Functions of RVs are RVs

## Expectations, Variance, and Moments


## Joint and Conditional Distributions

### Covariance and Correlation
* Covariance: $Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - EX)(Y - EY)] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$
  * Independent RVs have no covariance. 
* Correlation

### Conditional Expectations
* $E[X|Y]$ is a function of $Y$
* Law of total expectations states that $E[E[X|Y]] = EX$
